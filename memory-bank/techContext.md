- **Sync Method**: rsync with .gitignore and .rsyncignore filters

### IDE Support

- Primary: Cursor IDE with custom rules and commands
- iOS Build: Xcode (for archiving and TestFlight upload)
- Android: Android Studio capable (though Android not current focus)

## Platform Configuration

### iOS

- **Project**: Runner.xcodeproj (workspace-based)
- **Signing**: Requires distribution certificate for TestFlight
- **Bundle ID**: systems.boos.multiTimer (registered in Apple Developer portal)
- **Deployment Target**: Supports recent iOS versions
- **Capabilities**: Audio playback (configured)

### Android

- **Build**: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- **Build files**: build.gradle.kts
- **Current status**: Configured but not deployment focus

## Audio Assets

### File Formats

- **Format**: MP3 (universally supported)
- **Gong duration**: 6080ms (hardcoded constant)
- **Instruction durations**: Measured and hardcoded per file
  - ganzkoerperatmung.mp3: 8000ms
  - atem-halten.mp3: 8700ms
  - wellenatmen.mp3: 9000ms
  - nachspueren.mp3: 5600ms

### Asset Registration

All audio files must be declared in pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/gong.mp3
    - assets/debug/session1.mp3
    - assets/debug/session2.mp3
    - assets/release/ganzkoerperatmung.mp3
    - assets/release/atem-halten.mp3
    - assets/release/wellenatmen.mp3
    - assets/release/nachspueren.mp3
```

## Development Tools

### Version Control

- **Git**: Primary version control
- **Conventional Commits**: Enforced (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, ci:)
- **Co-authored commits**: AI agent contributions tracked

### Code Quality

- **flutter_lints**: ^6.0.0
- **analysis_options.yaml**: Configured linting rules
- **Dart formatter**: Standard formatting enforced

### Development Workflow

1. **Edit**: AI agent in Linux VM
2. **Sync**: rsync or git to Mac
3. **Build**: `flutter build ios` or `flutter run` on Mac
4. **Test**: Physical iPhone or iOS Simulator
5. **Commit**: Git with conventional commit messages

### CLI vs Xcode GUI builds

`flutter build ios` and `flutter run` invoke `xcodebuild` with their own build settings that override project defaults. Xcode's Product → Build uses project settings directly. This means issues like sandboxing (see Known Limitations) only surface when building via Xcode GUI, not via Flutter CLI.

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

- Physical iPhone device (USB connection)
- iOS Simulator (iOS 26.0 runtime installed)
- Debug mode with 16-second sessions for rapid iteration
- Free Apple Developer account sufficient for device testing

### Automated Testing

Three-layer strategy accepted (ADR-002):

- **Unit tests** — `test/unit/timer_schedule_test.dart` — in
  progress. `TimerSchedule` and event classes extracted and tested.
  Run with: `flutter test test/unit/`
- **Integration test** — `test/objective_c_test.dart` — checks
  whether `objective_c` package pin can be removed. Run with:
  `flutter test test/objective_c_test.dart` (makes network call)
- **Widget tests** — `test/widget/` — UI state transitions;
  requires injectable `AudioPlayer`; tools: `fake_async`,
  `mocktail`. Not yet started.
- **Manual protocol** — screen lock on real devices before each
  release; see `docs/architecture/concepts/test-strategy.md`

## Build Modes

### Debug

- Session durations: 16-17 seconds each
- Total sequence: ~2 minutes
- Enables rapid development iteration
- Activated via `kDebugMode` constant

### Release

- Session durations: 300-60-300-60-300-120-60 seconds
- Total sequence: 20 minutes
- Production breathing exercise timing
- Default for production builds

## Technical Constraints

### Known Limitations

1. **Timer Reliability**: App must remain in foreground with screen unlocked (documented in ADR-001)
2. **Audio Format**: MP3 works for current implementation; iOS notifications would require AIFF conversion
3. **Single Platform Focus**: iOS only for current iteration
4. **Network**: App fully offline; no network requirements
5. **Xcode GUI Sandboxing**: Since Xcode 15, `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` defaults to `YES` for new projects. CocoaPods script phases don't declare all inputs/outputs, causing "located outside of the allowed root paths" errors when building via Product → Build. Fix: set `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING = NO` in Podfile `post_install` hook. Reference: [CocoaPods #11946](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/11946)

### Future Technical Considerations

If implementing ADR-001 solution (notifications):

- Add `flutter_local_notifications` dependency
- Convert gong.mp3 to gong.aiff for iOS
- Add notification permissions
- Platform-specific configuration (AndroidManifest.xml, Info.plist)
- Timezone package dependency

## Deployment

### Current Status

- Development builds: Working on iPhone via Xcode
- TestFlight: ✅ Deployed and beta testers invited
- App Store: Not applicable (pending beta feedback)

### Deployment Guide

Complete TestFlight deployment process documented in `docs/appstore-submission-de-DE/README.md`

### TestFlight Requirements

1. Paid Apple Developer Program membership ✅
2. App Store Connect app record ✅ ("Multi Timer für Atempraxis")
3. Distribution certificate and provisioning profile ✅
4. Unique bundle identifier ✅ (systems.boos.multiTimer)
5. App icon (1024x1024) ✅
6. Privacy policy URL (if app collects data) ✅ (no data collection)
7. Export compliance information ✅ (handled during upload)

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Rsync Synchronization

Used to sync from Linux VM to Mac:

```bash
rsync -avz \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --filter=':- .gitignore' \
  --filter=':- .rsyncignore' \
  $USER@$IPV4_ADDRESS:$MULTI_TIMER_DIR/ ./
```

Preserves git repository while syncing code changes.

### Flutter Commands

```bash
flutter pub get          # Install dependencies
flutter run              # Run on connected device
flutter build ios        # Build iOS release
```

### Xcode Usage

- Open: Runner.xcworkspace (not .xcodeproj directly)
- Signing: Configure in Runner target settings
- Archive: Product → Archive (for TestFlight)
- Upload: Window → Organizer → Upload to App Store
