## Current Iteration Goal

**Fix screen lock issue to enable automatic display sleep mode**

Implement notification-based timing approach (documented in ADR-001) so users can complete the 20-minute breathing exercise sequence with their device's automatic display sleep enabled.

## Current Focus

### Step 0: Extract `TimerSchedule` 🚧 Nearly Complete

Extracting timing logic from `_TimerScreenState` into a pure Dart class. TDD approach.

**Completed:**

- ✅ `lib/timer_event.dart` — abstract base class with `offsetMs`, `Equatable`
- ✅ `lib/exercise_finished_event.dart` — extends `TimerEvent`
- ✅ `lib/playback_requested_event.dart` — extends `TimerEvent`, non-nullable `audioFile`
- ✅ `lib/timer_schedule.dart` — pure calculation, `buildEvents()` returns `List<TimerEvent>`;
  stateless helpers: `produceOptionalSessionStartPlaybackEvent` →
  `List<PlaybackRequestedEvent>`, `produceSessionEndPlaybackEvent` and
  `produceExerciseFinishedEvent` → single events
- ✅ `lib/session_data.dart` — `SessionData` extracted from `main.dart`
- ✅ `lib/constants.dart` — `kGongDurationMs` and `kGongAudioFile` extracted from `main.dart`
- ✅ `SessionData.durationMs` is now the backing field (was `durationSeconds`);
  getter removed; all `SessionData(...)` call sites pass milliseconds;
  `~/ 1000` workarounds removed from tests
- ✅ `test/unit/timer_schedule_test.dart` — full suite, all green:
  - `ExerciseFinishedEvent` offsets: empty, single, three sessions
  - `PlaybackRequestedEvent`: no sessions, single with audio, single without audio,
    two sessions (instruction offset, gong offset)
- ✅ Renamed `_startTimer()` → `_runExerciseSequence()` in `main.dart`
- ✅ `dart format` applied

### Up next: Notification-based background timing

Replacing `Future.delayed()` timer approach with OS-native scheduled notifications to maintain accurate timing when screen locks.

**Previous Achievement**: Audio volume increased and deployed as v1.0.0+2. All 4 German voice instruction audio files were re-exported at higher volume. Deployed to TestFlight.

**Previous Achievement**: TestFlight deployment completed successfully. All 8 steps completed:
- ✅ App Store Connect record created
- ✅ Distribution certificate configured
- ✅ Xcode project signing set up
- ✅ Build and archive created (with CocoaPods fix)
- ✅ MinimumOSVersion validation issue resolved
- ✅ Archive uploaded to TestFlight
- ✅ Apple build processing completed
- ✅ Beta testers invited

**Full deployment process documented in**: `docs/appstore-submission-de-DE/README.md`

### Current iOS Configuration

- Bundle identifier: `systems.boos.multiTimer` (registered in Apple Developer portal)
- App Store Connect name: "Multi Timer für Atempraxis"
- Local display name: "Multi Timer" (in Info.plist)
- Version: 1.0.0+2 (current TestFlight build)
- App icons: Complete set including 1024x1024 for App Store
- Git tag: v4 (tracks build 1.0.0+1; build 1.0.0+2 not separately tagged)

## Recent Changes

### Beta Feedback Received

**Priority 1: Screen Lock Issue**

- Beta testers reported that the screen lock limitation is their most urgent need
- They wish the app would work while automatic display sleep mode is enabled
- **Impact**: 
  - Users must manually disable auto-lock in Settings before each practice session
  - Users must remember to re-enable auto-lock after practice
  - **Security risk**: Forgetting to re-enable leaves device unprotected
  - Creates friction and cognitive burden (pre/post practice routine)
- **Decision**: Implement notification-based approach from ADR-001

**Priority 2: Audio Volume** ✅ Resolved in v1.0.0+2

- Beta tester suggested increasing the volume of the audio instructions
- **Impact**: Refinement - app was usable but audio could be clearer
- **Solution**: Re-exported all 4 German voice instruction audio files at higher volume
- **Released**: v1.0.0+2 deployed to TestFlight (build: Jan 17, 2026)

**Prioritization Rationale**: Screen lock issue creates security risk (users may forget to re-enable auto-lock) and adds friction to every practice session. Audio volume is an enhancement that can be addressed in a subsequent release.

### Previous Development

The git history shows steady development of the core breathing timer functionality:

- Latest feature: Added "Nachspüren" (sensing/feeling) session to complete the 7-session sequence
- Recent fixes: Audio playback reliability improvements
- Progress indicator: Visual feedback during exercise sequence
- Audio integration: German-language exercise instructions play before each session
- Debug mode: Shortened timings (16-17 seconds) for rapid development testing

## Active Decisions

### Confirmed by Beta Feedback

- ✅ Screen lock fix is the #1 priority (beta testers' most urgent need)
- ✅ Proceeding with notification-based approach from ADR-001

### Accepted Architecture Decisions

- ✅ ADR-001: Accepted — `flutter_local_notifications` chosen for
  background timer reliability
- ✅ ADR-002: Accepted — three-layer testing strategy
  (unit, widget, manual) chosen for notification refactoring

### Current Implementation Approach

- **Single increment delivery**: Develop complete feature with 11
  testable intermediate steps
- **Steps 1-7**: Additive infrastructure and validation (don't break
  existing functionality)
- **Step 8**: Transformation (replace timer with notifications)
- **Steps 9-11**: Refinement and edge case handling
- **Each step independently testable and committable**

**Prerequisite (Step 0): Extract `TimerSchedule`** — extract timing
logic from `_TimerScreenState` into `lib/timer_schedule.dart`. This
is required before unit tests can be written (ADR-002) and also
provides the notification schedule calculation (ADR-001). Should be
done before or alongside Step 1.

### Still Pending Beta Feedback

- Future product direction (private vs. public release)
- Additional features or breathing programs
- Timing customization needs

## Important Patterns

### Debug vs. Release Mode

The app uses Flutter's `kDebugMode` to switch between:

- **Debug**: 16-17 second sessions for quick testing
- **Release**: Full duration (300-60-300-60-300-120-60 seconds = 20 minutes total)

This pattern allows rapid iteration without waiting through 20-minute sequences.

### Audio File Organization

```
assets/
  - gong.mp3 (session end marker)
  - release/
    - ganzkoerperatmung.mp3 (full body breathing, ~8s)
    - atem-halten.mp3 (breath holding, ~8.7s)
    - wellenatmen.mp3 (wave breathing, ~9s)
    - nachspueren.mp3 (sensing, ~5.6s)
  - debug/ (not currently used in code)
```

German-language recordings provide exercise instructions before each timed session.

### Session Timing Architecture

Each session duration accounts for:

1. Audio instruction duration (pre-session)
2. Silent practice time (bulk of session)
3. Gong sound duration (6080ms, end of session)

The code subtracts audio and gong durations from total session time to achieve precise timing.

## Next Immediate Steps

**Step 0a — Wire `_runExerciseSequence()` to `TimerSchedule` (only remaining Step 0 item):**

Replace the inline timing loop in `_runExerciseSequence()` with a call
to `TimerSchedule(sessions).buildEvents()`. The loop currently
calculates delays manually using `Future.delayed()`. After this change
it drives execution by iterating the event list — still via
`Future.delayed()`. The switch to OS notifications comes in Step 8.

**Step 1: Foundation Setup** (after Step 0)

Add notification infrastructure without changing app behavior.

Tasks:

- Add `flutter_local_notifications` and `timezone` dependencies to
  pubspec.yaml
- Configure iOS (Info.plist permissions)
- Configure Android (AndroidManifest.xml)
- Initialize notification plugin in main()

Success criteria:

- `flutter pub get` succeeds
- App builds and runs without errors
- No behavior change — timer still works as before

Expected commit:
`build(deps): add flutter_local_notifications for background timing`

## Blockers

None identified. Prerequisites met:

- ✅ Paid Apple Developer account
- ✅ macOS with Xcode available
- ✅ Initial beta feedback received from both testers
- ✅ Technical solution documented (ADR-001)
- ✅ Implementation plan defined

## Project Insights

### Lean Approach

The project follows lean principles:

- MVP focused on single use case
- Small beta group for fast feedback
- Accepted known limitation to ship faster
- Clear decision point based on real usage data

### Development in Sandbox

Development occurs in a Linux VM to protect the host Mac from AI agent operations. Changes sync to Mac for iOS building via rsync with filters for .git, .gitignore, and .rsyncignore files.

### Shamanic and Yoga Practice Context

This is not a general-purpose timer app. It serves a specific breathing exercise rooted in self-healing principles from shamanic and yoga traditions. The fixed sequence and German audio instructions are intentional and core to this practice.
