# Active Context

## Current Iteration Goal

### Fix screen lock issue to enable automatic display sleep mode

Implement notification-based timing approach (documented in ADR-001) so users
can complete the 20-minute breathing exercise sequence with their device's
automatic display sleep enabled.

## Current Focus

### Audio Playback Simplification ✅ Complete

Simplified audio playback from stream-based `_playAudioAndWait` to
fire-and-forget `_play`. Completed this session.

**Completed this session:**

- ✅ `_play(String audioPath)` helper: stop + play, no waiting for completion
- ✅ `_playAudioAndWait` removed (eliminated `Completer`, `StreamController`,
  subscription boilerplate)
- ✅ `audioDurationMs` removed from `SessionData` (no longer needed)
- ✅ Loop in `_runExerciseSequence` rewritten: `_play(instruction)` →
  `Future.delayed(durationMs − kGongDurationMs)` → `_play(gong)` →
  `Future.delayed(kGongDurationMs)`
- ✅ `kGongDurationMs` corrected to `5670`
- ✅ Unit tests updated (removed 3rd `SessionData` constructor arg)
- ✅ All tests green, 2-minute debug run verified

**Design rationale**: `_runExerciseSequence` is the timing director.
`_play` is a thin wrapper. Instruction audio plays in the background
during the pre-gong `Future.delayed` — total session time is unchanged.

### Up next: Notification-based background timing

Replacing `Future.delayed()` timer approach with OS-native scheduled
notifications to maintain accurate timing when screen locks.

**Previous Achievement**: Audio volume increased and deployed as v1.0.0+2.
All 4 German voice instruction audio files were re-exported at higher volume.
Deployed to TestFlight.

**Previous Achievement**: TestFlight deployment completed successfully.

- App Store Connect name: "Multi Timer für Atempraxis"
- Local display name: "Multi Timer" (in Info.plist)
- Version: 1.0.0+2 (current TestFlight build)

- Git tag: v4 (tracks build 1.0.0+1; build 1.0.0+2 not separately tagged)

## Recent Changes

### Beta Feedback Received

#### Priority 1: Screen Lock Issue

- Beta testers reported that the screen lock limitation is their most urgent need
- They wish the app would work while automatic display sleep mode is enabled
- **Impact**:
  - Users must manually disable auto-lock in Settings before each practice session
  - Users must remember to re-enable auto-lock after practice
  - **Security risk**: Forgetting to re-enable leaves device unprotected
  - Creates friction and cognitive burden (pre/post practice routine)
- **Decision**: Implement notification-based approach from ADR-001

#### Priority 2: Audio Volume ✅ Resolved in v1.0.0+2

- Beta tester suggested increasing the volume of the audio instructions
- **Impact**: Refinement - app was usable but audio could be clearer
- **Solution**: Re-exported all 4 German voice instruction audio files at
  higher volume
- **Released**: v1.0.0+2 deployed to TestFlight (build: Jan 17, 2026)

**Prioritization Rationale**: Screen lock issue creates security risk (users may
forget to re-enable auto-lock) and adds friction to every practice session.
Audio volume is an enhancement that can be addressed in a subsequent release.

### Previous Development

The git history shows steady development of the core breathing timer
functionality:

- Latest feature: Added "Nachspüren" (sensing/feeling) session to complete
  the 7-session sequence
- Recent fixes: Audio playback reliability improvements
- Progress indicator: Visual feedback during exercise sequence
- Audio integration: German-language exercise instructions play before each session
- Debug mode: Shortened timings (16-17 seconds) for rapid development testing

## Active Decisions

### Confirmed by Beta Feedback

- ✅ Screen lock fix is the #1 priority (beta testers' most urgent need)
- ✅ Proceeding with notification-based approach from ADR-001

### Accepted Architecture Decisions

- ✅ ADR-001: Accepted — `flutter_local_notifications` chosen for
  background timer reliability
- ✅ ADR-002: Accepted — three-layer testing strategy
  (unit, widget, manual) chosen for notification refactoring

### Current Implementation Approach

- **Single increment delivery**: 16 independently testable and
  committable steps
- **Steps 1-2**: ✅ Complete — TimerSchedule extraction and cleanup
- **Step 3**: ✅ Complete — AudioPlayer injectable, widget test infrastructure
- **Steps 4-5**: Widget tests for `_runExerciseSequence()` and wiring to `TimerSchedule`
- **Steps 6-12**: Additive notification infrastructure and validation
  (don't break existing functionality)
- **Step 13**: Transformation (replace timer with notifications)
- **Steps 14-16**: Refinement and edge case handling

### Still Pending Beta Feedback

- Future product direction (private vs. public release)
- Additional features or breathing programs
- Timing customization needs

## Important Patterns

### Debug vs. Release Mode

The app uses Flutter's `kDebugMode` to switch between:

- **Debug**: 16-17 second sessions for quick testing
- **Release**: Full duration (300-60-300-60-300-120-60 seconds = 20 minutes total)

This pattern allows rapid iteration without waiting through 20-minute sequences.

### Audio File Organization

```text
assets/
  - gong.mp3 (session end marker)
  - release/
    - ganzkoerperatmung.mp3 (full body breathing, ~8s)
    - atem-halten.mp3 (breath holding, ~8.7s)
    - wellenatmen.mp3 (wave breathing, ~9s)
    - nachspueren.mp3 (sensing, ~5.6s)
  - debug/ (not currently used in code)
```

German-language recordings provide exercise instructions before each timed session.

### Session Timing Architecture

Each session duration accounts for:

1. Audio instruction duration (pre-session)
2. Silent practice time (bulk of session)
3. Gong sound duration (6080ms, end of session)

The code subtracts audio and gong durations from total session time to achieve
precise timing.

## Next Immediate Steps

**Step 4 — Write widget tests for `_runExerciseSequence()`:**

Write widget tests against the current loop using `fake_async` and
`MockAudioPlayer`. Tests must go green before proceeding to Step 5.
Infrastructure in place: `mocktail`, `fake_async`, `MockAudioPlayer`,
`test/widget/timer_screen_test.dart`.

**Stubs needed** (simpler than originally planned — no stream required):

```dart
when(() => player.stop()).thenAnswer((_) async {});
when(() => player.play(any())).thenAnswer((_) async {});
when(() => player.dispose()).thenAnswer((_) async {});
registerFallbackValue(AssetSource(''));
```

Scenarios to cover:

- Initial state: `AppBar` + "Start" button visible
- Counting state: black `Scaffold`, no `AppBar`, progress bar visible
- After completion: returns to initial state

Time control: `tester.pump(duration)` advances the fake clock for
`Future.delayed` and `Timer.periodic`. No stream emission required.

**Step 5 — Wire `_runExerciseSequence()` to `TimerSchedule`:**

Replace inline timing loop with iteration over
`TimerSchedule(sessions).buildEvents()`. Still uses `Future.delayed()`.
Widget tests from Step 4 serve as regression harness.

**Step 6 — Foundation Setup:**

Add notification infrastructure without changing app behavior:

- Add `flutter_local_notifications` and `timezone` to pubspec.yaml
- Configure iOS (Info.plist permissions)
- Configure Android (AndroidManifest.xml)
- Initialize notification plugin in `main()`

Expected commit:
`build(deps): add flutter_local_notifications for background timing`

## Blockers

None identified. Prerequisites met:

- ✅ Paid Apple Developer account
- ✅ macOS with Xcode available
- ✅ Initial beta feedback received from both testers
- ✅ Technical solution documented (ADR-001)
- ✅ Implementation plan defined

## Project Insights

### Lean Approach

The project follows lean principles:

- MVP focused on single use case
- Small beta group for fast feedback
- Accepted known limitation to ship faster
- Clear decision point based on real usage data

### Development in Sandbox

Development occurs in a Linux VM to protect the host Mac from AI agent
operations. Changes sync to Mac for iOS building via rsync with filters for
.git, .gitignore, and .rsyncignore files.

### Shamanic and Yoga Practice Context

This is not a general-purpose timer app. It serves a specific breathing
exercise rooted in self-healing principles from shamanic and yoga traditions.
The fixed sequence and German audio instructions are intentional and core to
this practice.
