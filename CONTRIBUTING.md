# Contributing

## Requirements

- Android Studio (prerequisite for Flutter)
- Flutter SDK (version 3.0.0 or newer)
- Dart SDK
- macOS and Xcode (if you want to run on iOS)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Install npm development tools, e.g. `markdownlint-cli`

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the App

Run on an emulator or physical device:

3. **Run the app**:
    - Connect your iPhone with a USB cable
    - Select your device at the top
    - Click the **Play** button (or press `Cmd + R`)

4. **Trust the developer**:
