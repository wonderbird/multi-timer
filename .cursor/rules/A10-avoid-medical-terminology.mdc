# Avoid Medical and Therapeutic Terminology

## Regulatory Context

In Germany, medical and therapeutic applications require validation. Non-compliance can result in significant fines. Therefore, this application must NOT be positioned as a medical or therapeutic tool.

## Prohibited Terms and Phrases

Avoid using the following types of terms in all textual content:

- Medical terminology: "treatment", "therapy", "diagnosis", "patient", "clinical", "medical", "cure", "heal"
- Therapeutic claims: "therapeutic", "remedial", "rehabilitative", "medicinal"
- Health claims that imply medical benefits: "treats", "prevents disease", "cures", "relieves symptoms"
- Professional medical context: "doctor", "physician", "healthcare provider", "prescription", "consultation"

## Acceptable Alternatives

Instead, use neutral, descriptive language focused on personal practice and traditional techniques:

- "user" or "practitioner" instead of "patient"
- "session" or "practice session" instead of "treatment session"
- "practice" or "breathing practice" instead of "therapy" or "treatment"
- "technique" or "method" instead of "therapeutic approach"
- "well-being" or "personal development" instead of "health" (when in medical context)
- "support" or "guide" instead of "treat"
- "tool" or "application" instead of "medical device" or "therapeutic tool"
- "breathing exercise" or "breathing technique" instead of "breathing therapy"
- "traditional practice" instead of "treatment modality"
