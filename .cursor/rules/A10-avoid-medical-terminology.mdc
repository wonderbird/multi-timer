# Avoid Medical and Therapeutic Claims

## Regulatory Context

Under German and EU law (Heilmittelwerbegesetz/HWG and EU MDR 2017/745), software becomes a regulated medical device based on its "intended purpose" stated in labeling, documentation, and marketing. Medical devices require CE marking, regulatory approval, and clinical validation. Non-compliance risks significant penalties.

**Critical principle:** The trigger is not terminology itself, but CLAIMS about:

- Diagnosing, preventing, monitoring, treating, or alleviating disease
- Therapeutic or medical benefits
- Effects on health conditions or symptoms
- Professional medical use cases

## Terminology Guide

Position the app as a wellness/lifestyle tool. Replace medical terms with neutral alternatives:

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|----------|----------------|
| patient | user, practitioner |
| treatment session | session, practice session |
| therapy, treatment | practice, breathing practice |
| therapeutic approach | technique, method |
| health benefits | well-being, personal development |
| treat | support, guide |
| medical device | tool, application |
| breathing therapy | breathing exercise, breathing technique |
| treatment modality | traditional practice |
| doctor, physician | (omit or use "guide", "instructor") |
| diagnosis, cure, heal | (avoid entirely) |
| clinical, medicinal | traditional, established |

## App Positioning

Frame this app as: **A timing and guidance tool for traditional breathing exercise sequences** rooted in shamanic and yoga practices. Emphasize personal practice, self-exploration, user autonomy, and general wellness. Never claim medical benefits, symptom relief, disease prevention, or treatment of conditions.

## Scope

This rule applies to all user-facing content: UI text, documentation, code comments, error messages, App Store materials, variable/function names, TestFlight instructions, and beta communications.

## Examples

**❌ Prohibited (Medical/Therapeutic Claims)**

"This breathing therapy treats psychological issues" • "Therapeutic technique for healing trauma" • "Use for treatment of anxiety" • "Clinical breathing exercise" • "Patient progress tracking" • "Relieves stress symptoms" • "Prevents panic attacks"

**✅ Acceptable (Wellness/Lifestyle Framing)**

"Traditional shamanic breathing technique" • "Breathing exercise rooted in yoga traditions" • "Tool for personal breathing practice" • "Technique for self-exploration" • "User progress tracking" • "Supports personal well-being" • "Used by practitioners for general wellness"
